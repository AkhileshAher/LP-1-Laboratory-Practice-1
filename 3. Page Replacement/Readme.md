# 📄 Java Paging Simulation

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Write a Java program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to simulate memory paging with the following page replacement algorithms:
1. 🔁 FIFO (First-In-First-Out)  
2. 🧠 LRU (Least Recently Used)  
3. 🔍 Optimal Page Replacement  

## 🛠️ Features
- Implements core OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Simulates page replacement and counts page faults
- Frame-by-frame memory state display

## 📥 Input
- Number of page frames  
- Reference string  
- User choice of algorithm  

## 📤 Output
- Total page faults  
- Page hits  
- Memory frame status after each reference

## 👨‍💻 Tech Used
- Language: Java  
- Data Structures: Queue, Stack, List, Map
